WoodCutter
==========

Plugin for Minecraft Servers.

WoodCutter brings more realism to your Minecraft server. With this plugin, all the logs in a tree will fall when you cut the bottom one. This only works if you have an axe in your hand (need for axe can be turned off). There's also an option to only enable tree-felling when you are sneaking. This plugin works on all logs.
